# HaskellFun

## About
Some fun practice scripts in Haskell!

## Running one of the scripts
To run one of these scripts, you must first have installed the `GHC`
[Haskell compiler](https://www.haskell.org/ghc/). Then, to run a script with
the interpreter, run the following in the terminal:
```bash
runhaskell <script_name>.hs
```
You can also compile the code for better performance:
```bash
ghc <script_name>.hs [options]
```
